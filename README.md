## Theme & typography

The site will be clean, simple and easy to use. Will not be too busy, or give the user information overload at any stage.

Chosen font used throughout is Baloo Thambi 2, chosen for the clean, simple and easy to read style.

Colours are designed to be soft and pastel like, the below colour palette was generated using [coolors](https://coolors.co/)

<a name="database"></a>

## Database features/design

All data is stored in MongoDB in one collection

- Plants - this stores the users records of plantings, designed to be created/updated at three different times:
  - Planting time:
    - Year planted, month planted, what planted, packaging image (an upload of a picture of the seed packet), planting notes
  - Growing time:
    - Growing notes
  - Harvest time:
    - Harvest date, harvest image (an upload of an image of the grown plant), harvest notes and a "Would you grow again?" option

<a name="left"></a>

## Features left to implement

- User profiles: this will allow signed-in users to have personal profiles and edit their own plantings only as well as contributing to the overall community

- Currently the site is designed for UK users only, to be able to select specific countries/communities would also be a desired feature

- Due to the database structure, the search feature requires that the user types in the full plant name in order to find the relevant record

## Testing
<a name="code"></a>

### Code

- **HTML:** All tested with [W3S HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/), checked by rendering each page in the browser and right clicking and viewing ```Page source``` to ensure code being rendered excludes the jinja template language

1. 404.html: No errors found
2. base.html: No errors found
3. create.html: No errors found
4. index.html: No errors found
5. norecord.html: No errors found
6. read.html: No errors found
7. update.html: An error comes from the fact that the templates gives a value from the existing database record field, an acceptable error as this aids user use

- **CSS:** style.css tested with [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator), no errors found

- **Javascript:** scripts.js tested with [JSLint](https://jslint.com/), no errors found except for Undeclared '\$', coming from the use of JQuery and negated by adding the use of JQuery as a global variable in JSLint

- **Python:** Code tested with pylint:

Some errors arose and remain;

1. Unused argument "error_handler", this argument is only used to render the 404 page when the url is incorrect, acceptable error
2. Possible unbalanced tuple, arising due to flask pagination, acceptable error
3. Unused import env, arising due to the storing of environment variables in env.py, acceptable error

### User story testing

Tested against [User Stories](#userstories)

"As a new user: I want to understand what the site does and how it can help me. I want to feel that the site
will be easy and intuitive, and that it will serve a purpose to me"

The above was tested by sending a link to various friends and family as first-time users, feedback as to intuitive usability was encouraged and acted upon

"As an existing user: I want a record of the vegetables I have grown over time, I want to know what has been successful for me and for others, and what has failed."

The above requirement is achieved through the fact that each record has a "Grow again?" option so users are able to see what failed and what has been a success

"As an existing user: I want to be able to update records according to the lifecycle of plants throughout the growing season, I want to be able
to track the various stages of growing and use this information to help me in the future"

The above requirement is satisfied by the user being able to add initial planting information, return to the record and update it through the growing season with relevant growing information and again return when the plant is harvested to update final harvesting notes

"As an existing user: I want this site to be specific to the experience of growing vegetables in my country, and growing conditions in my country, rather than using generalized information
available on other worldwide sites"

The site specifies that this is a UK based one, users should be aware of this, site moderation would be needed to ensure that this standard is maintained

"As the site owner: I want to ensure that the site is focussed on UK plant growings to best
serve the target market. Anything beyond this should be deleted"

This can be satisfied by the site owner acting as a moderator both in terms of the quality of records and also as a check that records are specific to the UK

## Issues & bugs

### Closed issues

Bootstrap and Materialize both used initially, until I realised that this causes issues in terms of the class names causing clashes. I realised this issue, and made the decision to switch to using Materialize only

Issues with the Materialize forms corrected by ensuring that the div structure was corrected

### Open issues

Possible for a user to enter a harvest date being prior to the planting date. The decision to manage this through site moderation was made
