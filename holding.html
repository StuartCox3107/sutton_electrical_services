        <p class="card-text">I am Blake. I love horror characters. these are my favourite characters. I collect the Toony terror figures. I like playing Luigi's mansion 3 on Nintendo switch and jumping on my trampoline. 
        I also like horror costumes and dressing up. I like Friday 13th because strange things happen on that day. I also love colouring in pictures.
        <br><br>
        My bedroom is scary with lots of horror pictures and also i keep my figures there. My play room is fun and full of toys and I have graffiti pictures in there.
